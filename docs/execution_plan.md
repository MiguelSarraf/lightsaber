# Execution plan

## Unity tests

- [ ] nodeMCU heart beat
- [ ] nodeMCU server and write to EEPROM
- [ ] giroscope
- [ ] mp3 player
- [ ] led strip
- [ ] button

## Current measures

After those is tested, I will measure the current drawn by each module to estimate the battery capacity I need.

After that, I will buy and test the battery charging modules and the battery monitor.

## Final assembly

With everything properly tested, I will assemble all the parts and develop the final code. Probably I will do it in several micro-steps.
