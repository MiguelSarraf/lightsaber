# Lightsaber

This repository contains code and documentaion for the lightsaber I am building for myself.

I am using a ESP8266 nodeMCU and a bunch of sensors and activators.

Full documaentaion containing technical draws, cost control, execution and tests plan can be viewed in `docs` directory.

Feel free to reuse any of the code I developed.
